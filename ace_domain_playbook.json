      "content": "When checking domain availability, implement a timeout mechanism to handle potential delays. If a timeout occurs, attempt to switch to an alternative domain lookup service to ensure reliability. Example: Start with Service A, set a 5-second timeout; if Service A times out, switch to Service B. To improve reliability, test multiple services in advance to determine which is most responsive, and consider adjusting timeout settings based on service performance.",
